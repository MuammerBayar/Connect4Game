<!-- ABOUT -->

## 🧐 About <a name = "about"></a>
This project includes a Connect Four game developed using the Java programming language. The game is presented as a desktop application with a simple interface. Connect Four is a strategy game where two players take turns trying to achieve their goals.

The object of the game is to line up the four game pieces horizontally, vertically or diagonally, thus completing a line. Players take turns placing their pieces at the top of the game board, and the pieces are placed upwards, starting from the bottom rows. The player who puts the first four pieces together wins the game.

The Connect Four game was developed using the Java programming language as a desktop application. The use of Java has enabled the game to be presented with a user-friendly interface. The interface allows players to see the game board, place their pieces and follow the game status.

The game makes the necessary checks to determine when players place their pieces, a winner or a tie. If a player aligns the four pieces correctly and forms a line, they win the game. Otherwise, the game ends in a draw.

The Connect Four game is platform independent as it was developed using the Java programming language. Therefore, it can run on different operating systems such as Windows, Mac or Linux.

The project can be a great example to improve your skills in Java programming language and desktop application development.
